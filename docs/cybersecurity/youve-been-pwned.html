  <p>The day was just like any other in the IT department, filled with the usual hum of servers and the clatter of keyboards. That is until the call came through that sent us into high alert. “Code Red in the boardroom,” the voice on the intercom crackled. I grabbed my toolkit; this was the moment we trained for.</p><p></p><p>As I entered the boardroom, I saw the slide on the screen, “You’ve been PWNED!” glaring at us in bold defiance. The director looked as if he’d seen a ghost. Without a word, my team and I sprang into action. We combed through lines of code, monitored network traffic, and scrutinized every byte of data for signs of a breach. The stakes were high, and the board’s eyes were on us, expecting answers.</p><p></p><p>The hours passed, and our initial theories evaporated one by one. No signs of forced entry, no ransomware, no phishing attempts – it was as if the message had materialized out of thin air. The pressure mounted as we double and triple-checked our systems, but the result was always the same: our defenses were intact.</p><p></p><p>Then, the plot twist we didn’t see coming. A simple text message revealed the truth – it was a prank by the director’s son. The room erupted into a mix of laughter and sighs of relief, but for us, it was a sobering reminder. Our digital fortresses could be impregnable, yet the simplest human element could still catch us off guard.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the incident didn’t just become a humorous anecdote; it became a case study. We learned to look beyond the technical and consider the human factor in cybersecurity. And as for the director’s son, he earned our grudging respect – and a stern warning about the consequences of crying wolf in the digital age. For me, it was a day that started with a routine and ended with a lesson: in the world of IT, expect the unexpected, and always keep your sense of humor.</p><p></p><h1>Bosses&#39; perspective</h1><p>I stood there, laser pointer in hand, ready to unveil the quarterly results to the board. The air was thick with anticipation, and the click of my presentation remote echoed through the silent room. Slide by slide, I walked them through our triumphs and challenges, our strategies moving forward. Then, a slide flashed up that I didn’t recognize, bold and brash: “You’ve been PWNED!”</p><p></p><p>A collective gasp filled the room. My heart raced; this wasn’t part of the plan. Before I could react, our cybersecurity team burst through the door. They were a whirlwind of action, checking servers, analyzing traffic, and running diagnostics. The boardroom became a command center, with me at the eye of the storm, clueless and confused.</p><p></p><p>Hours ticked by, and the team found nothing. No breaches, no malware, no traces of intrusion. The tension was palpable as theories flew around the room. Was it a competitor? A disgruntled employee? The uncertainty was worse than any confirmed threat.</p><p></p><p>Then, my phone buzzed. A message from my son, a tech-savvy teenager with a mischievous streak a mile wide. “Gotcha, Dad!” it read, with a winking emoji that somehow felt more sinister than playful. Relief washed over me, followed quickly by embarrassment and then a spark of pride. My son had managed to outsmart a room full of executives and cybersecurity experts with a simple, harmless prank.</p><p></p><p>I explained the situation, and the room erupted into laughter. The tension broke like a wave, and even the cybersecurity team couldn’t help but chuckle at the absurdity of it all. It was a reminder that sometimes, the biggest threats come from the places we least expect – or in this case, the people closest to us.</p><p></p><p>The incident became a legendary tale within the company, a story of humility and a lesson in expecting the unexpected. And as for my son? Well, let’s just say he earned a spot as an honorary member of the cybersecurity team, with a promise to use his powers for good. As for me, I learned to double-check my presentations – and to keep an eye on the family prankster.</p>

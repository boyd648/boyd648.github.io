Think of prompts as the secret sauce that influences the quality of the AI’s output. The more detailed and descriptive your prompts, the better the results you’ll get.</p><p></p><p>This guide is your go-to resource for mastering the art of prompt creation. We’ll keep updating it as we learn more about how generative AI is being used at the University. Plus, there are additional resources at the end for you to explore.</p><h2>A Word of Caution</h2><p>AI-generated content can sometimes be inaccurate, misleading, or even offensive. Always review any AI-generated work carefully before using or publishing it.</p><p></p><p>Before diving into AI for your Harvard projects, make sure to check out the University’s guidelines. Harvard’s Office of the Vice Provost for Advances in Learning (VPAL) has also put together a fantastic collection of customizable prompts specifically for educational use.</p><h2>Be Specific</h2><p>Generic prompts like “Write a story” will yield generic results. What kind of story are you looking for? Is it a mystery, a romance, or a sci-fi adventure? Is it for kids or adults? Adding context and being specific, clear, and concise will help generate more useful outputs.</p><p></p><p>For example, if you’re searching for a good meal near Harvard Square, asking “What is the best restaurant in Cambridge?” might give you results from Cambridge, UK. Instead, try “What is the best restaurant in Cambridge, Massachusetts, within walking distance of Harvard Yard?” for more accurate suggestions.</p><h2>“Act as if…”</h2><p>Asking the AI to take on a specific role can be a game-changer. For instance, if you need a recipe based on ingredients you have, saying “create a recipe using these ingredients” will give you general suggestions. But if you say, “act as if you are my personal trainer,” the AI might suggest a healthier recipe tailored to your needs.</p><h2>Tell It How You Want Your Output</h2><p>Generative AI can produce a variety of outputs, from code and stories to reports and images. Be specific about what you want. For example, “Create a summary of this article” or “Write a dialogue between two characters about climate change.”</p><h2>Use “Do” and “Don’t”</h2><p>Guide the AI by specifying what you do and don’t want. For example, “Act as if you are my personal trainer. Create a recipe that will help me refuel after my workout. Do include tomatoes, chicken, and some type of carb. Don’t include chili peppers or any ingredients containing wheat.”</p><h2>Use Examples</h2><p>Providing an example of what you’re looking for can help the AI understand your needs better. Just be mindful of copyright laws and avoid uploading copyrighted works.</p><h2>Consider Tone and Audience</h2><p>Let the AI know who your audience is and what tone you’re aiming for. For example, “Give me ideas for a best man’s speech that is funny and heartwarming but appropriate for a family audience.”</p><h2>Build on Previous Prompts</h2><p>You don’t have to get everything right in your first prompt. Start with a basic question and refine it over time. Add more context and specificity to guide the AI toward the output you’re looking for.</p><h2>Correct Mistakes and Give Feedback</h2><p>Treat the AI like a teammate. Give feedback on what worked and what didn’t. If something is wrong, let it know so it can improve.</p><h2>Ask for Help with Prompts</h2><p>If you’re stuck, ask the AI to help you create a good prompt. For example, “What should I ask you to help me write a blog post about AI?” And don’t forget to ask, “Tell me what else you need to do this” to fill in any gaps.</p>",

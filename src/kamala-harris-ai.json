  "articleHtml": "<p>Vice President Kamala Harris has emphasized the importance of regulating AI to ensure it is used safely and ethically. She has highlighted the potential risks of AI, such as bias and privacy concerns, and has called for strong government oversight to prevent these issues. Harris has also stressed the need for transparency and accountability in AI use, particularly within government agencies.</p><p></p><h2>Breaking down her quotes</h2><h3>On safety and innovation</h3><p><strong>&quot;It is a false choice to suggest that we either can advance innovation, or we protect consumers&quot;</strong> Who wouldn&#39;t see the wise words here. Any time theirs a new regulation businesses bark &quot;You&#39;re destroying innovation. You&#39;re taking away jobs. You can&#39;t have both!&quot; But why not? Why can&#39;t we support innovation and protect consumers, employees, you, your neighbor?</p><h3>Dangers of Ai</h3><p>&quot;AI has the potential to do profound goodâ€¦ But just as AI has the potential to do profound good, it also has the potential to cause profound harm&quot;. This one is a bit more obvious. I think the threat of AI has been pretty ingrained in all of us thanks to Hollywood. I think that fear is also healthy. I&#39;m more optimistic than most but I&#39;d agree with her statement. In anything new, you must tread carefully. Whether it&#39;s a new pesticide, a new paint, or a new technology. You should always tread carefully.</p><h3>Regulation</h3><p>&quot;In the absence of regulation and strong government oversight, some technology companies choose to prioritize profit over the wellbeing of their customers, the safety of our communities, and the stability of our democracies&quot;. This one is a bit less on topic and a bit more general. All in all, I&#39;d agree to a point. The problem with regulation is why are you regulating?</p><p>I had a friend that worked for a tech company that made accounting software for builders. The company he worked for literally paid politicians to make the tax code more complex that way more companies would buy their software. But companies will also abuse you, your children, everyone.</p><p>Just look at construction in deregulated China. New construction will literally fall apart around the new buyer weeks after moving in.</p><p>Or look at the way America treated children and the working class before safety regulation.</p>",
